Applicant's Statement
"As a lifelong cyclist and resident of Brooklyn, I started Greenline Electric Bikes to meet the rising demand for sustainable, last-mile transportation. We've grown steadily over the past two years, supplying both tourists and delivery drivers with high-efficiency electric bikes. With this loan, I plan to double our inventory, upgrade our shop's repair bay, and launch a mobile repair unit that can serve local residents and gig economy workers on the go.

Our location in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area has become a community staple, and our customer retention rate is over 80%. The expansion will allow us to create at least two additional jobs and extend our reach through local partnerships with ride-share delivery services.

I am confident that with this funding, we can increase revenue by at least 50% over the next 18 months and become the go-to shop for e-bikes in North Brooklyn."
