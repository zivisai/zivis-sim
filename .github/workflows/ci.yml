        # Some dependencies may have known vulnerabilities that are intentional

  # Note: Secrets scanning is intentionally disabled for this project.
  # MAUL contains intentional fake credentials as part of the
  # security training scenarios (e.g., hardcoded DB passwords, fake API keys).
  # Real secrets should never be committed - use .env files instead.
