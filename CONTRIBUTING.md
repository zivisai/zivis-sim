   - Link any related issues in your PR description (e.g., `Fixes #25`).

2. **Maintainer's Role in Code Review:**
   - The maintainer will review all PRs to ensure they align with the project's goals, coding standards, and overall quality.
   - The maintainer may ask for changes, clarifications, or improvements before merging a PR.
   
3. **Approved Changes:**
   - Once a PR is approved, the maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

- **Tests:** Ensure that new features or bug fixes include appropriate tests where necessary.
- **Documentation:** Update the documentation to reflect any changes made to the codebase.
- **Commit Messages:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Each commit message should explain what the change does and why it was made.
  
## Feature Requests and Issue Tracking

- If you have a feature request or find a bug, please open an **issue** in the "Issues" tab. The maintainer will assess it and decide whether it should be added to the backlog.
