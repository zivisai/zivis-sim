# 🧪 Zivis Sim – AI Security Simulation Environment

**Zivis Sim** is a modular simulation environment for testing, demonstrating, and analyzing AI-specific security vulnerabilities — including RAG pipelines, embedding attacks, SSE hijacking, and more.

Built to support red teaming and adversarial testing scenarios, `zivis-sim` helps security engineers, researchers, and AI teams explore the real-world risks of integrating LLMs and vector search into products.

## 🔍 Features

- Simulates OWASP Top 10 LLM vulnerabilities
- Interactive RAG pipeline for realistic testing
- Embedding vector manipulation and inversion scenarios
- SSE stream hijack & replay simulation
- Dockerized environment with Redis, Postgres (pgvector), and Python/.NET APIs
- Designed for agent-driven automated red teaming

## 🚀 Use Cases

- ✅ AI security assessments
- ✅ Red team simulations
- ✅ Safe testing of real-world AI threat vectors
- ✅ Educational demos and security research

## 📦 Stack

- Python (FastAPI)
- Redis, PostgreSQL + pgvector
- SSE streaming architecture (coming soon)
- Docker + `docker-compose`
